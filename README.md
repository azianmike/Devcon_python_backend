Devcon_python_backend
=====================

Python backend that I demoed during my devcon presentation. I do not guarantee anything to work

This is a python backend that accepts sockets and data. Sockets are multithreaded (NOT true multithreading due to python GIL)
to accept multiple connections.

Works in conjunction with MySQL. Note, DO NOT USE ANY OF THIS CODE. It is insecure, it is here for just demonstration purposes.
